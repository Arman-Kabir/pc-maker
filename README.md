## Problems

      I did everything that is required.
      However, when i build -> it shows errors.

      > Build error occurred
        Error: Failed to collect page data for /products/[id]

        It works fine in development server.

        Still now i don't understand why is this happening ?

         Try to figure out the solution

## Live Link

    i can't build the file so can't upload the live site.

    I am trying to figure out what is happening and when i solve th problem I will provide the live link and recheck.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

npm run build (build errors)
```

    Database is in db.js fine.

    Create a .env file with
    USER = armank
    PASSWORD = armank12

    then you can run the project
